## Onboard sensor
This tutorial guides you on how to connect your sensor to The Things Stack (TTS) platform. The steps involve logging on to a prepared account, device registration, and code implementation for sending data via LoRaWAN.

## Visualize data using Datacake
In this tutorial, you learn how to visualize sensor data on a cloud dashboard using Datacake and The Things Network. Steps include setting up an account on both platforms, linking them via a webhook, creating a device on Datacake, defining specific fields for sensor data, creating a payload decoder, and then finally setting up a dashboard with widgets for real-time data visualization.
